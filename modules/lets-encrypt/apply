echo "
This module will acquire an initial Let's Encrypt certificate to be used with an
nginx docker container, and as part of the process, certbot will automatically
schedule tasks to handle its periodic renewal.

Please note: this module is designed to be run ad hoc after Fetch Apply initially
configures a server and it has been rebooted. This module should only ever need
to be run once on a server, and should not be run continuously or automatically.
Running this module will modify and restart the nginx docker container multiple
times, disrupting network traffic.
